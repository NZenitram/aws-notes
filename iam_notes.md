#### IAM 101 (Identity Access Management)
  -  Allows you manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console
  - Centralized control of your AWS account
  - Shared access to your AWS account
  - Granular Permission
  - Identity Federation
  - Multi Factor Auth
  - Provide temporary access for users and devices to services
  - Set up and manage a password rotation policies

### Key Terms

  - Users
  - Groups - Collection of users under one set of permissions
  - Roles - You create roles and you can assign them to AWS resources
  - Policies - A Doc that defines one or more permissions. Policy documents are assigned to users groups or roles

### IAM 101 Lab
  - Customize account alias (Updates users sign in link)
  - Activate MFA on your root account
  - Create individual IAM users
  - Use groups to assign permissions
  - Apply an IAM password policy

  The `secret access key id` will only be available once. If they are lost they will need to be recreated and updated for programmatic access.
